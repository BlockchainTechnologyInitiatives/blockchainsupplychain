				<h1>Houston’s First Blockchain Technology Week to Highlight the Impact of Blockchain on Today and Tomorrow’s Businesses</h1>
				<br>
				<h3 style="text-align:center">The Computer Science Department and C.T Bauer Business School, University of Houston launches a week-long blockchain event hosting two education and networking programs for corporate executives and business leaders in supply chain and logistics from December 3rd to the 6th.</h3>
				<br>
				<p>HOUSTON, TX, November 1, 2018 -- Blockchain, born just a decade ago and mainly linked to Bitcoin for most of its existence, is now blooming into the next big technology and is bringing about incredible business transformation. A recent report published by the World Economic Forum (WEF) suggests that Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) like blockchain could boost trade by more than $1 trillion in the next 10 years.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Despite this projected growth, many question if blockchain is a justifiably substantial technology or just a lot of hype. According to the report ‘by removing barriers and streamlining trading processes, DLT could facilitate up to $1.1 trillion of new trade volume, roughly a 30% increase’. WEF statistics such as the previously mentioned beg the question ‘do business professionals clearly understand what blockchain is and what it can do? And if not, how do they position themselves to quickly and efficiently utilize this new technology for gaining competitive advantage?’</p>
				<br>				
				<p>The University of Houston has launched its first ever Blockchain Technology Week - a collaboration between the University of Houston’s Department of Computer Science, C. T. Bauer College of Business, TerraHub and Blockchain Technology Initiatives. The joint effort is designed to provide answers for business professionals involved in automating and digitalizing processes within supply chains. The four day long proceedings will be showcasing various practical blockchain applications within the supply chain space delivered by high-level decision makers. In addition, the week will provide an overview of this new technology that is said to be rapidly changing how organizations conduct business.</p>
				<br>				
				<p>Kicking off Blockchain Technology Week will be XChain2, a two day conference held on December 3rd and 4th, 2018. XChain2 is heavily supported by many local government institutions such as Port Houston and the Greater Houston Partnership. The conference will address through expert panels and keynote sessions how this revolutionary technology could solve real world problems in supply chain and logistics. Over 30 presenters such as Vincent Annunziato, Director, Business Transformation & Innovation Division at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, will reveal the latest findings from their most recent pilot project, in addition to discussing other CBP blockchain initiatives.</p>
				<br>				
				<p>Srini Vasan, co-founder of eShipGlobal, will be presenting his soon to be deployed blockchain platform, a solution that allows export licenses and compliance checks to be confirmed by smart contracts. Other presenters will showcase proof-of-concepts, pilot projects, and commercialized use cases of blockchain and the value these projects have added for their respective stakeholders. The conference will be led by speakers from global companies such as Ernst & Young, GS1, Perkins Coie, Chevron, Deloitte and the Maersk-IBM Joint Venture; TradeLens.</p>
				<br>				
				<p>Blockchain Technology Week will continue on December 5th, with a two-day course developed by the  C. T. Bauer College of Business, University of Houston and TerraHub. The course will combine lectures and roundtable discussions. It will explore digital transformation, industrial blockchain foundations and business management in addition to providing practical use cases on how cloud computing, IoT, Artificial Intelligence, and blockchain.</p>
				<br>				
				<p>Dr. Dale Tibodeau Professor of Supply Chain Management at the C. T. Bauer College of Business is excited to be launching the workshop. “With the constant need to improve supply chain performances, we feel that blockchain can help to add transparency to complex systems. In addition, it creates more efficient flows of information up-and-down the chain. Business leaders should be looking at emerging technologies and how they can improve current business practices, which is why we are very excited to be running this management training course with Terrahub”.</p>
