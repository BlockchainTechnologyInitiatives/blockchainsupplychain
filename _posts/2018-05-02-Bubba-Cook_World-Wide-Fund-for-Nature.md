Bubba is the Western and Central Pacific Tuna Programme Manager.  This programme is administered by the WWF-International Smart Fishing Initiative (SFI), but depends on the support and coordination of WWF offices throughout the South Pacific, including WWF-NZ, where Bubba is currently hosted.

The role requires him to work closely with governments to negotiate support for sustainable management of the South Pacific tuna stocks.  Bubba first came to work for WWF in 2006 after working for several years at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Fisheries Service’s Alaska Region managing fish stocks such as the red king crab, which was made famous by the Discovery Channel’s “Deadliest Catch”.

Bubba has spent a lifetime in and on the ocean, having grown up on the Gulf of Mexico, toured the Pacific in the U.S. Navy, worked as a fisheries regulator in Alaska, and served in a small coastal village in Fiji as a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer.
