Dan Harple is the CEO of Context Labs, B.V., which is based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and Cambridge, Massachusetts. He has been a technology entrepreneur for more than 20 years, having founded and built technologies, companies, and products that have been used by billions of Internet users, merging companies with Netscape Communications, Oracle, and a joint venture with China’s Sina, providing core underlying technology for its Weibo platform.

Harple has had a seminal influence on the commercial Internet thanks to his pioneering of voice over internet protocol (VoIP), streaming media, and interactive screen sharing/shared whiteboards, in the early ‘90s. He has been behind innovations driving a range of patents that are some of the most cited for: collaborative computing, VoIP, streaming media, real-time web communications, big data integration, and location-based social media. Harple’s influence underlies technologies that power Skype, GoToMeeting, Webex, SmartBoards, Oracle Fusion, Sina Weibo, and YouTube, among others. Recent work centers on big data, blockchain, and supply chain analytics.

He served as an entrepreneur in residence (EIR) at MIT as well. Dan founded Context Labs, which uses big data analytics to describe the growth of innovation ecosystems and clusters. These early efforts partnered with the MIT Media Lab’s work on City Science in the Changing Places Group.
