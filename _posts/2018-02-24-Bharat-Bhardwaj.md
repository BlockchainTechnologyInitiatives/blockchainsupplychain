Dr. Bharat Bhardwaj established Noahs Ark Chemicals in 2001 and has grown it into a successful trading and distribution company operating globally. Always looking to innovate Dr Bhardwaj has developed an online platform, GoBuyChem.com, which takes traditional ways of transacting chemicals and commoditising the process. “If it is possible to buy an aeroplane online then why not chemicals?“

In his presentation Dr Bhardwaj will explain why GoBuyChem is not just a dating site, simply matching buyers and sellers, but instead provides a digital way of servicing the whole of the supply chain bringing benefits to both buyers and sellers. He will also highlight in detail the potential impact of blockchain on the distribution and supply chain aspects of distribution of chemicals.
