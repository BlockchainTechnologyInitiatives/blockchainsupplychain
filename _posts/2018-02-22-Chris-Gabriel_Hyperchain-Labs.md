Chris Gabriel founded Hyperchain Labs in early spring 2018 and deployed the
first ever, oil & gas blockchain network based on Hyperledger Fabric and running
on the IBM Blockchain Cloud Platform.  Hyperchain Labs focuses on reducing costs for our
customers by eliminating the need for disparate, untrusted networks that are expensive to maintain.  
Hyperchain Labs recently completed its proof-of-concept for an oil & gas truck ticketing blockchain network
to automate the crude oil run ticket process as well as produced water hauling by integrating IoT sensors
and robotic process automation with legacy ERP systems to automate the end-to-end transaction process
integrating smart contract execution to effectively 'Uberize' oilfield trucking.

In October 2018, Hyperchain Labs started the design work for an agribusiness supply chain network
that will utilize a blockchain network to bring fertilizer, chemical, and seed producers onto the same
permissioned network as retailers, wholesalers, and farmers to see inventory, orders, and deliveries
in near real-time to reduce costs for all network participants.  

By providing Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) including use case evaluation, network design, build, and
smart contract review & deployment, Hyperchain Labs acts as the neutral blockchain network operator
for consortiums in any industry.

In addition to his work with Hyperchain Labs, Mr. Gabriel is also a regular contributor to the
Hyperledger Project hosted by the Linux Foundation where he is a member and
actively contributes to the documentation working group.

Abstract:
On a blockchain network, smart contracts can be thought of as the non-legal parts of the agreement that
can be converted from negotiated terms (on paper) into computer code for the purposes of executing
end-to-end transaction processes in a much more efficient manner, thus reducing costs
as very little human verification is required.

Simply put, smart contracts are coded to enforce some contract terms automatically as certain
requirements of the agreement are met such as milestone payments to the supplier based on the
acknowledgment of goods receipts at the purchaser for example.  Taken a step further, price validation
against a received invoice can also be automated in a smart contract.

<br>
Mr. Gabriel will also be a panelist discussing:
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Understanding the Value and Advantages of Utilizing Smart Contracts Over Existing Methods</b></p>

<p>--What does it mean to digitalize the contract process in regards to real-time delivery and exchange of custodies?</p>
<p>--Enabling transactional trust between parties through the use of an immutable ledger</p>
<p>--Understanding the implications of amending or voiding smart contracts</p>
