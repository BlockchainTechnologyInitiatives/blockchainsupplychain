Kate Lybarger is the Global Vegetable Information Lead at Monsanto Company. Kate joined Monsanto in 2016, and quickly fell in love with the purpose agriculture serves and the potential for emerging technologies to create a meaningful impact. Kateâ€™s focus is to steward data globally and to align the Vegetable Seeds business to emerging opportunities that unlock growth and delight our customers. 

Prior to Monsanto, Kate spent 11 years between Wells Fargo & Company and Reinsurance Group of America building and delivering digital products, innovation programming, strategic growth pilots, process development and human capital strategies. She is a resident of St. Louis, a native of Ohio (Go Bucks!), and, when not indulging in all things blockchain, spends her free time navigating the world of home renovation!
