## Abstract

Distributed ledger use cases, which have the highest potential of impacting the supply chain, have been envisioned by the business and thought leaders, and are now being proven by the implementers - one PoC at a time. NTT DATA led the industry by implementing some of these use cases in the last three years. To realize the promised potential of increasing trust, connectedness and speed of transactions, we had to solve some unique technology, data, administration, policy, standards and usability issues. This session will present our tryst with this unique technology, some of the challenges that we solved and some that we are still solving. It will be especially beneficial for those in supply chain area who want to move beyond use case validation and take the first step towards blockchain success.
