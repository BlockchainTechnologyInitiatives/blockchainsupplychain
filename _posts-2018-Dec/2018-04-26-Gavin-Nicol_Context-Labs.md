Gavin has been a technology leader and innovator for 25+ years working at corporate research centers in Japan, and corporations and startups in the US and the Netherlands. Through his work at EBT, a founding member of the W3C, he has broadly influenced many of the technologies underlying the modern web. He played a significant role in the development of the HTML, HTTP, XML, XSL, DOM, XPath, SVG, XQuery and XLink standards, and in building some of the earliest prototypes and implementations of the technologies. He is considered “the father of I18N on the WWW”. His innovations span a broad range of technologies, including distributed hypermedia, text processing, natural language processing, management of large documents, stylesheet-driven conversion and delivery capabilities, real-time graph processing, use of neural networks in recommendation engines, complex event processing, syntax-driven semantic data integration, geospatial analysis, search technologies, versioned NoSQL database engines, distributed ledgers, and reputation networks. Several of the innovations developed by Gavin and his colleagues underlie many aspects of the modern web and many were years ahead of their time. These innovations have also appeared in many leading-edge products, such as the award-winning DynaWeb, Dynabase and Engenda products, Oracle Fusion integration server, Gypsii location-based social networking platform, and the technology underpinning Sina Weibo, one of the largest social networks in China (with currently over 300M users). At Citizens Bank, he headed mobile development, shipping new features faster than thought possible. His work at Context Labs focuses on scalable blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, trust models, security models, identity models, large scale data analytics, graph analytics, and on applications of these technologies within verticals
