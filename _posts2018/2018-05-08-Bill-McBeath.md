Bill McBeath is co-founder and Chief Research Officer at ChainLink Research, a leading analyst firm in supply chain, Internet-of-Things, and blockchain. McBeath has conducted over 50 primary research projects, covering supply chain best practices, and use cases and business implications of technology across manufacturing, wholesale, retail, and logistics sectors. 

ChainLink Research is a recognized leader in custom research and advisory services, with a focus on supply chain, Internet-of-Things, and blockchain. Founded in 2002, our emphasis from the start has been on inter-enterprise interactions and architectures (‘the links in the chain’). We have conducted over 75 primary research projects in which we interviewed and surveyed over 5,000 professionals. Much of our research focuses on industry-specific use cases, business cases and ROI, and drivers/inhibitors of technology adoption and business change. As a result, we have developed a deep, multi-industry practice, founded on real-world, validated, supply chain-wide, end-to-end perspectives that have helped our clients understand, plan, and succeed as they move into the future.
